/**
 * Enum for dealing with the Device Response from the MQTT server.
 * It's handy to constrain the values that are allowed, and also
 * there is just one place to go if the names change.
 *
 * There's just something about hardcoded literal strings that
 * goes with JSON processing that I don't like. This is my way of
 * dealing with it. There are probably better ways. Open an issue.
 * Let's talk about it.
